In this study case i'll be constructing a gallery for fantasy-oriented TTRPG Dungeon Masters. "What's that Goni?", you could be thinking. As a storytelling narrator, the Dungeon Master often encounter him/herself with a lack of inspiration to plan which will be the next adventure to throw at his/her friends. In most cases a book helps, but in other it cannot. 

So i will take the Scryfall API database and, searching and displaying the art of the Magic The Gathering TCG, be ofering quick and random reference. This is a study project in my Front-End Javascript learning road.

# What I'm learning here

- Fetch API.
- Promises and asynchronous Javascript.
- Arrays and objects manipulation.
- Functional programming.
- Javascript modularization.
